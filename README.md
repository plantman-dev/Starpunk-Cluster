# Starpunk-Cluster
A path into uncharted space.

# Dependencies:
This is really important, so read carefully!
- Atmosphere Utilities (by me): https://spacedock.info/mod/4047/Atmosphere%20Utilities
- VertexMitchellNetravali: (by pkmnaiko): https://github.com/pkmniako/Kopernicus_VertexMitchellNetravaliHeightMap/releases
- VertexColourMapEmissive (by Lt_Duckweed): https://spacedock.info/mod/3620/VertexColorMapEmissive
- Kopernicus (by prestja): https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases
And that's it!

# Recommended mods:
- Blackrack's Volumetric Clouds or EVE (for volumetric cloud cover and auroras).
- Scatterer (for more realistic atmospheres, oceans, sunflares and ghosts).
- Deferred (better lighting and performance).
- KSPCommunityFixes (for bug fixes).

# Notes:
If you're puzzled why I have posted a github repo instead of a spacedock link, it's because the mod (in my opinion) is not ready for full release yet, so I would like downloads to be available to those who join here, this allows me to debug more efficiently and improve the mod further.
I am certain there will be bugs in this version (mainly graphics-related, e.g weird cloud tiling and scaled-space issues), and if there are any, please report to the #:beetle:-bugs  section so I can pinpoint the exact issue.
